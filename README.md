Stained Glass Task Tracker

Tracker allows you to enter your tasks, project, date and hours spent on those tasks. You are only allowed to edit or delete your own tasks. This is a very basic task tracker that could be further developed in the future.



To use this app, just clone, run 'Bundle Install', `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.
